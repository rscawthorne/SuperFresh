# SuperFresh

The xampp folder contains everything required to run the website, including:  
Apache web server, MySQL database and PHP pre-hypertext processor.

Files that were created by me can be found at:  
C:\xampp\htdocs\
and,  
C:\xampp\mysql\data\freshveg

To get started:
1) Copy the xampp folder to C:\\ so that you have C:\xampp\
2) Run xampp-control.exe, this will bring up the XAMPP control panel.
3) On the control panel, start the Apache and MySQL services.
4) On the control panel, click the [Admin] button on the Apache row, this will open the website in your browser.
5) View the website, you can see how it would appear to unregistered users.
6) At the top-right of the website, you can login as an admin with the username "1" and password "1".
7) You can now view the website as an admin or registered user.
8) The admin menu and forms allow the creation of new users and website content.
