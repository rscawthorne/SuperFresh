Using College Webserver I set you up with:

Go to your database
https://82.165.157.28:8443/phpMyAdmin and enter your StudentID and database password. 

click on database (admin_s101010) (101010 is your student number)
click sql tab
copy and paste farmshop code and run, this will make all tables and sample data.

Now open db.php (1010101 is your student number)
change database connection details:

   define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
   define('DB_USERNAME', 's101010');
   define('DB_PASSWORD', 's101010');
   define('DB_DATABASE', 'admin_s101010');

upload all files to your server with FTP client (filezilla for example)

Thats about it.

The Farmshop username and password is user1 - See database tables for info.


Else WAMP etc users

Same applies except that you go to localhost/phpmyadmin for database, make a new database name it whatever. Now your db.php file should be updated according to your database login. Normally the username is root and password is nothing, database name is whatever database you made.

   define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
   define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
   define('DB_PASSWORD', '');
   define('DB_DATABASE', 'DATABASE NAME');
